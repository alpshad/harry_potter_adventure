The official repository for CS SAIL 2018, CYOA: HP <br/>

This repository is for CS SAIL students taking the Create Your Own Adventure: HP class. Our goal is to teach students how to parse JSON using GSON, and use that knowledge to create their own adventure game. Basic Java knowledge and OOP knowledge is recommended.
